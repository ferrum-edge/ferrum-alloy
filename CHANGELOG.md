# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

- **Changed default:** `telemetry.request_id.accept_incoming`
  (`RequestIdConfig::accept_incoming`) now defaults to `trusted_peers`, like
  `trace_context.accept_incoming`, instead of `any`. A request id sent by a
  peer the trust classifier does not trust is replaced by a generated one,
  which handlers see and responses echo, so a caller can no longer choose the
  id its request is logged, traced, and retained for diagnostics under. Set
  `any` to keep every caller's id; configuration validation now warns about
  it. **Upgrading behind Ferrum Edge:** Edge's correlation ids are kept only
  when Edge is a trusted peer. List it in `[trust]` (`trust.identities`,
  preferred, or `trust.networks`), or set `accept_incoming = "any"`;
  otherwise Alloy logs, traces, and retains Edge's requests under generated
  ids that differ from the id Edge echoes to its client, and retrieval by
  that id finds nothing.
- Diagnostic evidence retention is shared fairly between tenants: under the
  count or byte bound, a tenant evicts another tenant's oldest record only
  while that tenant holds more than it, and otherwise its own. One tenant's
  traffic can still evict another tenant's records down to an equal share,
  as a newly active tenant does, but no further. The store no longer keeps
  the slots of records evicted out of order. Its fixed per-record byte
  estimate rises from about 330 to about 770 bytes on 64-bit targets, so a
  `diagnostics.max_bytes` sized for a number of small records now holds
  about half as many (roughly 2.2 times fewer); a record with the longest
  tenant, id, and route is charged about 2 KiB.
- Retained diagnostic evidence is filed by who chose the request id
  (`RequestEvidence::request_id_origin`, `evidence::RequestIdOrigin`:
  `generated`, `trusted_peer`, `untrusted_caller`), and a lookup prefers a
  generated id, so an id a caller sends back cannot join or evict a generated
  id's records; the report says how many records a less trusted origin
  filed under the id. Under one id, records whose trace context was accepted
  or whose id was generated or chosen by a caller are bound to the first
  record's trace: a later request of another trace that reuses the id is not
  retained, is counted as
  `ferrum_alloy_diagnostics_skipped_total{reason="request_id_conflict"}`,
  and is noted in the report. Records whose id a trusted gateway sent without
  trace context, as Ferrum Edge's retries arrive unless its `otel_tracing`
  plugin is attached, are grouped by the id alone: the first record is
  always kept, and the report notes that they may include other requests
  that reused the id. Reports carry a `request_id_origin` attribute on each
  `alloy.response` event.
- Harden the diagnostics reader against hostile reports and OTLP files.
  `parse_offline` now discards supplied findings after checking their count
  and shape, so `ParsedReport.report.findings` is always empty and findings
  come only from `analyze` (behavior change for library callers; the warning
  now says the findings were discarded). The pre-validation string-length
  walk formats a location only for an error, so long keys above a wide array
  no longer multiply its work. Parser error locations escape control
  characters and Unicode line separators in keys. OTLP `max_spans` now
  counts every span entry read, valid or not. `render_text` writes control characters other than tab and
  Unicode line separators inside report, finding, and warning values as
  escape sequences (`\n`, `\u{1b}`, `\u{2028}`, ...), so a value cannot
  forge lines or terminal controls in human-readable output, including for
  library callers. Addresses
  GHSA-wf6p-cw5w-h579, GHSA-65px-xjrq-gq7m, GHSA-7cjx-8mc3-p2gx, and
  GHSA-h3m2-gxq9-62h7.
- Reject service manifest proxy IDs when a generated upstream or plugin ID
  would exceed Ferrum Edge's 254-character resource ID limit.
- Correct `alloy.response.body.bytes`: it counts the data-frame payload bytes
  handed to Hyper after the response's inner layers ran, so with compression
  enabled it reports the compressed frame payload. It excludes HTTP framing and
  TLS overhead and is not proof the client received it.
- Correct the documented `x-ferrum-mcp` validation scope: a disabled
  document-level extension still checks top-level closed keys, the `enabled`
  boolean type, and per-operation metadata, while `endpoint`, `namespace`,
  `include`, `exclude`, `limits`, and `forward_request_headers` are validated
  only when it is enabled. Add adjacent disabled/enabled tests.
- Pin Ferrum Edge v0.9.10 and keep v0.9.9 as the previous supported release.
  Re-audit Edge #5954: MCP request charset checks and fail-closed handling for
  uninspectable or over-nested JSON-RPC batches do not change contracts Alloy
  consumes. The `X-Gateway-Error` vocabulary remains the same eight tokens,
  and the ferrum-contracts pin remains `contracts-edge-0.9.9`.
- Document the central ferrum-contracts store, vendor and pin the diagnostic-ref v1 schema, and correct the shared `[agents]` schema status.
- Interpret Ferrum Edge v0.9.9 backend attempt spans for per-attempt timing,
  connection setup, and connection reuse; preserve the v0.9.8 multiple-attempt
  behavior when attempt spans are absent. Rule `alloy.r003` (now version 3)
  compares each attempt with the service request under it, reports a service
  that outlasted its attempt as conflicting evidence, and treats an attempt
  span without both timestamps as unavailable. A buffered attempt is compared
  only when it carries `gateway.backend.connection.reused`, because Edge's
  HTTP/3 bridge to an HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 backend can end a buffered attempt at
  its response head.
- Rules `alloy.r001` (now version 3) and `alloy.r004` (now version 4): bumped
  for the attempt-span linkage added in #111, which changed their wording for
  every input and their output on Edge v0.9.9 input.
- Retry backoff is not attributed: Edge v0.9.9 states only that backoff falls
  between attempt spans and exports no backoff duration, so Alloy derives
  none from the gap between them. This is deferred until Edge measures it.
