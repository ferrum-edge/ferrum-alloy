## [Unreleased]

- Interpret Ferrum Edge v0.9.9 backend attempt spans for per-attempt timing,
  connection setup, and connection reuse; preserve the v0.9.8 multiple-attempt
  behavior when attempt spans are absent. Rule `alloy.r003` (now version 3)
  compares each attempt with the service request under it, reports a service
  that outlasted its attempt as conflicting evidence, and treats an attempt
  span without both timestamps as unavailable. A buffered attempt is compared
  only when it carries `gateway.backend.connection.reused`, because Edge's
  HTTP/3 bridge to an HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 backend can end a buffered attempt at
  its response head.
- Rules `alloy.r001` (now version 3) and `alloy.r004` (now version 4): bumped
  for the attempt-span linkage added in #111, which changed their wording for
  every input and their output on Edge v0.9.9 input.
- Retry backoff is not attributed: Edge v0.9.9 states only that backoff falls
  between attempt spans and exports no backoff duration, so Alloy derives
  none from the gap between them. This is deferred until Edge measures it.
